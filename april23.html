 <p>The Puppeteer’s Assistant was commissioned by Adult Swim and was first broadcast as part of their official compilation Adult Swim Smalls Vol 5. The film is based on a made up urban legend that I invented that you can’t give puppets salt water to drink or something terrible will happen. Visually the film is a collaboration between animator Hannah Schilsky, designer Glitter Macabre and myself.</p>

 <p>This piece showcases the ritual of fruit cutting as an expression of apology, appreciation, and adolescence; a love language of sorts within different Asian cultures. The visuals follow a familial voice-over between the artist's parents as they discuss their collective love of mangoes. 
Dedicated as a love letter to my parents and William Carlos Williams.</p>

 <p>After discovering a deer carcass in her neighborhood, a girl begins to conflate herself with the image, causing her to look closely at her life. The question leads her down a rabbit hole of self reflection, artistic ritual, and dreamlike premonition, bringing the goriest depths of her subconscious into her reality. 
With a new understanding of herself, the girl attempts to reconnect with her everyday life while acknowledging her past.</p>

 <p>One day, I bought a small lot of someone's old Super 8 home movies for 15 bucks off eBay. When I projected them on my wall, I was fascinated by just how many of the rolls were family summer vacation footage and started thinking about how I was watching some random stranger's memories and wondering why/how they ended up for sale online. I felt this weird obligation to destroy the footage afterwards so I set out to do that using layered rephotography and a live noise soundtrack created with my friend Bruce using the projector's motor sound as our original source.</p>

 <p>ZEROZEROZEROZERO is a short experimental animation by Isa Karliner-Li aka isamisomiso. The film explores the spatial, social and psychic world of the transfeminine subject. Opening to a scene of a photogrammetric street corner, the film uses spatial mapping to render the psychic and otherworldly. Inspired by the Bushwick queer/trans experimental noise scene, isamisomiso employs noise music by FUCKM3IMSICK to emphasize the intensity of balancing divinity and psychosis - a consistent motif in all of her projects.</p>
