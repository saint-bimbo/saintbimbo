  <h2>APRIL 11TH OFFICIAL PROGRAM</h2>
  
  <p><b>PART I</b></p>
    
    <p><i>The Puppeteer's Assistant</i>			Dylan Mars Greenberg

The Puppeteer’s Assistant was commissioned by Adult Swim and was first broadcast as part of their official compilation Adult Swim Smalls Vol 5. The film is based on a made up urban legend that I invented that you can’t give puppets salt water to drink or something terrible will happen. Visually the film is a collaboration between animator Hannah Schilsky, designer Glitter Macabre and myself.

    <i>The Comatose Woman</i>			Neverending Audit

The rodeo in her mind may seem like a hoot and a holler but make no mistake, this is a classic tale of a woman in trouble. Carla San Rio stars as the comatose woman in The Comatose Woman.
With music by Stice!*         *Remixed by Neverending Audit

<i>Papergirl</i>			Jack Warren

A lonely partygoer undergoes a strange metamorphosis.

<i>August</i>				Tony Scalzo

A music video for August by Famous Letter Writer feat. Vince Quatroche. 

<i>Be Not Afraid</i>				Elias Rivera

A collage

<i>Closer</i>				Sebas Alarcon

A study made by the Film Share

<i>This is Just to Say</i>			Ayesha Bashir

This piece showcases the ritual of fruit cutting as an expression of apology, appreciation, and adolescence; a love language of sorts within different Asian cultures. The visuals follow a familial voice-over between the artist's parents as they discuss their collective love of mangoes. 
Dedicated as a love letter to my parents and William Carlos Williams.

<i>Who raised you?</i>			Blair Taller

After discovering a deer carcass in her neighborhood, a girl begins to conflate herself with the image, causing her to look closely at her life. The question leads her down a rabbit hole of self reflection, artistic ritual, and dreamlike premonition, bringing the goriest depths of her subconscious into her reality. 
With a new understanding of herself, the girl attempts to reconnect with her everyday life while acknowledging her past.

part i runtime: 45 mins

      <b>PART II</b>

<i>Projections of a Free Mind</i>			Peter Cerrito

A dance study in disassociation, it can be hard to keep up with yourself but it can be beautiful if you make it so. 

<i>Redbirds</i>			Nicholas Umpierrez

There is joy left in the corners where we forgot to look. There will never be a reason to stop the joy.

<i>The Press Conference</i>			Ben Lipkin

What is the ends of all this archiving? Are we archiving ourselves away?

<i>The Taking of Jordan (All American Boy)</i>			Kalil Haddad

Jordan, an amateur adult performer, recalls the horror of his many former lives.

<i>Drown</i>				Duncan Taylor

One day, I bought a small lot of someone's old Super 8 home movies for 15 bucks off eBay. When I projected them on my wall, I was fascinated by just how many of the rolls were family summer vacation footage and started thinking about how I was watching some random stranger's memories and wondering why/how they ended up for sale online. I felt this weird obligation to destroy the footage afterwards so I set out to do that using layered rephotography and a live noise soundtrack created with my friend Bruce using the projector's motor sound as our original source.

<i>ZeroZeroZeroZero</i>			isamisomiso

ZEROZEROZEROZERO is a short experimental animation by Isa Karliner-Li aka isamisomiso. The film explores the spatial, social and psychic world of the transfeminine subject. Opening to a scene of a photogrammetric street corner, the film uses spatial mapping to render the psychic and otherworldly. Inspired by the Bushwick queer/trans experimental noise scene, isamisomiso employs noise music by FUCKM3IMSICK to emphasize the intensity of balancing divinity and psychosis - a consistent motif in all of her projects.
