<h3>On a Real Train _ Henry Camacho [2 min]</h3>
<p>This video was made during the summer of 2020, when I was listening to Dean Blunt's album Zushi a lot and wanted to further explore editing with color key effects. On the way to see some friends in Long Island, I took a video out the window of the LIRR, and started working from there....</p>

<h3>That you had not made me a woman _ Sarah Lou Haddad [2.5 min]</h3>
<p>This video explores the difference between men's and women’s daily morning blessings in the Jewish prayer of Shacharit.
By juxtaposing the feminine body with the literal words of the prayer, I attempt to address the feminine Jewish body and its place within the Jewish religion.</p>

<h3>Systole _ Emma Penrose, Zack Shorrosh, Sandro Gomes [2 min]</h3>
<p>Systole (2022) is a 2 minute silent film shot in chronological order on one 100’ daylight spool of 16mm Ektachrome film. It was developed & spliced by hand, then spooled onto a reel with films by fellow Casa do Xisto artists in residence for its premiere screening at the Curtas Vila do Conde International Film Festival. This film was made possible by Casa do Xisto residency in Barcelos, Portugal.</p>

<h3>Lifeforce _ Cherry Nin [15 min]</h3>
<p>In Life Force, Cherry Nin utilizes alchemical methods of filmmaking to weave together an apocalyptic articulation of sexuality and nature, as it exists in a post-industrial U.S. city landscape—i.e. the idea of “life force” as intrinsically queer, in decay, dead, and situated within multiple trajectories of power and matter. Though the repercussion of these trajectories is separation, a relentless reaching towards each other and towards life persists.</p>

<h3>Somethin’- _ Bhs Two, Jayson-James Sloan [1.5 min]</h3>
<p>A man gives a Psa to black america about the lack of tipping delivery drivers.</p>

<h3>Vacuumism _ Alex Killgore [7 min]</h3>
<p>When all hope is seemingly gone, the Vacuum becomes solitude. Weaved into the darkness of the void, there is a shimmer of light that has manifested into The Self. Can We usher in a new era of art? Are We able to shed the skin of the Past? </p>
<p>Vaccuumism examines the Now as a opportunity for true unfettered growth. For too long We’ve needed something New. Through Our own collectively imposed self isolation, the possibilities are suddenly infinite.</p>

<h3>MY MOVIE 441 COMPARISON _ Elias ZX [4 min]</h3>
<p>Super 8mm film about my ancestors and also babies.</p>

<h3>Malchut Shlema _ Gabi Rudin [6.5 min]</h3>
