<p> Saint Bimbo is the patron saint of beauty for beauty's sake, art for art's sake, making friends and having fun, trusting your heart and fearing no one.</p>
  
<p> Saint Bimbo's Film Church is an organization which creates a community space for visual artists to meet and share their work that may not fit into hegemonic short film programming. SBFC is a strictly non-commercial space, as of yet working just through the generosity of donations from our patrons. Saint Bimbo is the patron saint of all experimental, queer, avant garde, DIY filmmakers, especially those who lack the funds to submit their work to festivals, to galleries, to apply to residencies- whose work deserves to be shared, and deserve to receive that kinetic feedback of energy that being in a room with like minded artists provides. SBFC exists outside of commercialization, monetization, and profits, and our goal is to create a sanctuary apart from the heavily capitalized world of film and movies. As the medium of film and media becomes more accessible as a no-budget art form, Saint Bimbo believes the spaces for sharing visual art should adapt as such, moving away from traditional theaters into a revitalization of the 18th century salon, or in this case, Film Church.</p>

<p> Ultimately, SBFC is a space for creativity, expression, and play. The only projects we turn away are ones with racist, transphobic, or any form of hateful intolerant message or imagery. Our programs are curated but still eclectic, and no matter what everyone gets to leave seeing something new. I created SBFC because I know so many very talented procrastinators, and I wanted to give them a deadline for their personal work, which is so easy to push to the side in this world that keeps you so busy with simply making rent. Equally as importantly, SBFC is always a night to meet and hang out with other passionate artists and commune with the ancient gods of pure human creativity & expression.</p>

  <p>Visual media as it exists widely today in a commercial sense serves to reduce our sense of agency, that is, gradually train us out of it. Every picture is a picture of the past. The more time we spend submerged in recorded media, the less time we spend in the present- with a reality which includes us, where we have the power for immediate action that affects the world. The limited capacity we have for interaction with the infinite videos we consume on a daily basis reflects the temporal dissonance between the recording and your interaction with it. 
Conversely, the rise of advertising invisibly integrated into so much of this daily media conspicuously appeals to our sense of desire, a sense that is rooted in the future. Aspirational media eats at one’s sense of gratitude. It is well known that advertising functions on the basis of encouraging unhappiness, and advertising is more ubiquitous than ever. Our minds are grappling constantly between these past and future states, leaving very little energy left over for where our bodies exist in the specious present. This combined decline in agency and growth in dissociation has led us to an epidemic of spiritual dysmorphia. </p>
  
  <p>“Keeping people in a constant state of lack, in perpetual desire, strengthens the marketplace economy. Lovelessness is a boon to consumerism.” - bell hooks</p>
  
  <p>Growing up in a time after God has died, my generation struggles to find community in spirituality. I think we are misjudged as being anti-religion, when we are really anti-corruption, which unfortunately overlaps with and eschews many of the widely organized religious communities available to past generations. The tenets of religion that are integral to human nature, that is community, moral codes, and cultural myths, I and many like me found in movies and TV.</p>

<p>We are not here to make the claim that capitalism killed God, so as to avoid the equations of correlation vs. causation, however, the two forces can never coexist. Charity and humility are antithetical to universal participation in a capitalist society. God could not just be killed, he first had to be disgraced. 
The new gods of capitalism are opulence and infinity- infinite availability, and infinite disposability- and we are now realizing that infinity is not the same as abundance. What is infinite is inherently not precious, it does not inspire gratitude. Abundance moves in cycles of nature. To be surrounded by abundance is to be surrounded by love, to be surrounded by infinity is terrifying.</p>
  
  <p>“A capitalist society requires a culture based on images. It needs to furnish vast amounts of entertainment in order to stimulate buying and anesthetize the injuries of class, race and sex. And it needs to gather unlimited amounts of information, the better to exploit the natural resources, increase productivity, keep order, make war, give jobs to bureaucrats. The camera’s twin capacities, to subjectivise reality and to objectify it, ideally serve these needs and strengthen them. Cameras define reality in the two ways essential to the workings of an advanced industrial society: as a spectacle (for masses) and as an object of surveillance (for rulers).” - Susan Sontag</p>
  
  <p>It is our belief that by taking media into the hands of the people, for organizing spaces which promote films made with love and not simply made to be consumed, we can understand better our own voices and desires.</p>
